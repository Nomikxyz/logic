# logic
Logic is a new (absolutely terrible) programming languge. 

At the moment, it's supposed to be a no-frills kind of language with only basic functions. The idea is that there should be little to no need for pseudocode because everything is so straightforward.

Obviously, don't try to write actual code in Logic. 

Definitions and syntax can be found in the LogicParser.scala file (will be published in the README or another file at some point).
